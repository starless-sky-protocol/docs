# Public Identity

Public identities are made up of a few fields that are visible to network users. Some fields are optional and others are controlled by network administrators.

Fields such as name or biography are optional and the identity holder himself chooses his values. Since a public key is unique and non-transferable, it can become an entity's public address and reveal who it is if its holder wants to.
